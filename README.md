# HKMap
Hollow Knight game map application to point what has been done.

It's a simple app designed to point what's already been done within the Hollow Knight map.
It is in an initial but functional version.


## How it works:


Mouse over the corners of the screen to move the camera (like league of legends camera)
Scroll zooms in and out
Click to point something done on the map, click again to unpoint
